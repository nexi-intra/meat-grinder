_"From Hero to Zero – Make Action Scripts That Can Be Debugged Locally and Execute Globally"_

Welcome to the **Koksmat-Grinder** repository—your one-stop pipeline for turning raw ingredients (code, configurations, tests) into fully-formed deliverables. Think of it as a metaphorical grinder, taking in all sorts of inputs and consistently churning out reliable, shippable outcomes. Instead of managing a buffet of disjointed Cloud Native tools, we’re streamlining the entire process using only GitHub Actions at the core of our assembly line.

## Why "Koksmat-Grinder"?

In the world of Cloud Native, it’s easy to feel like a hero juggling countless tools—Argo CD, Argo Workflows, Crossplane, and beyond. But there’s a cost: complexity, steep learning curves, fragmented pipelines, and slow feedback loops. **The Koksmat-Grinder** is about simplifying that: feed in what you have, let one robust, predictable mechanism do its work, and produce a uniform output ready for production.

### The Core Idea

- **From Hero to Zero:** Move away from the sprawling toolchains and adopt a minimalistic approach.
- **GitHub Actions as the Engine:** All CI/CD, packaging, testing, and even infrastructure tasks run through GitHub Actions, centralizing your workflow in a single, accessible place.
- **Debug Locally, Execute Globally:**  
  Use [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) (or similar tools) to run and debug your GitHub Actions locally. Quick iteration happens on your machine before scaling up to global, cloud-hosted runs.

### Koksmat: The Missing Ingredient

**Koksmat** is a concept/tool under exploration to add a pinch of extra spice to this simplified approach. Where Koksmat-Grinder standardizes the pipeline, Koksmat aims to enhance it—filling gaps and offering patterns that speed up your day-to-day work. It might help with boilerplate generation, specialized workflows, or tackling those edge cases that currently require multiple third-party integrations.

**Note:** Koksmat is in its infancy. Consider this a call for contributions and critiques. How can we make these simple pipelines even more delightful?

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Action Blueprints:** Ready-to-use GitHub Actions workflows for building, testing, packaging, and deploying apps or infrastructure components.
- **Local Debug Recipes:** Guidance on how to use `act` or other tools to quickly run pipelines locally, so you can fail fast and fix faster.
- **Koksmat Integration Points:** Early examples and experiments that hint at how Koksmat could integrate into a Koksmat-Grinder workflow—like templates, scripts, or reference configs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone This Repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/Koksmat-Grinder.git
   cd Koksmat-Grinder
   ```
2. **Install Local Debug Tool (`act`):**
   Follow the instructions from [act’s repository](https://github.com/nektos/act) to get set up.
3. **Run a Workflow Locally:**

   ```bash
   act -l
   act push
   ```

   Tweak the `.github/workflows/` YAMLs and re-run until you’re satisfied. Once stable locally, commit and push, and watch it execute globally in GitHub Actions.

4. **Explore Koksmat Concepts:**
   Check out the `koksmat/` directory for early prototypes. Consider it a sandbox for new ideas—your feedback and experiments are encouraged.

## Contributing

We welcome all forms of collaboration—contribute Action templates, propose features, share your debugging workflows, or experiment with Koksmat additions. Let’s craft a simpler, more maintainable CI/CD story together.
